About ToMoBAR
*******************

The general concept
=====================
ToMoBAR is a Python and Matlab (not maintained atm) library of direct and model-based 
regularised iterative reconstruction algorithms with a plug-and-play capability. 
ToMoBAR offers you a selection of various data models and regularisers resulting in 
complex objectives for tomographic reconstruction. The software can handle multi-GPU parallel 
reconstruction in Python and also device-to-device methods operating purely on CuPy arrays.


TomoPhantom also offers simple linear dynamic extensions of 2D and 3D phantoms.

The generated byt TomoPhantom projection data is
compatible with widely-used open-source tomographic reconstruction 
software: the ASTRA-toolbox and the TomoPy packages.
