ToMoBAR's documentation
=======================

**ToMoBAR** (cite [CT2020]_, [SX2022]_) is a Python and Matlab 
(not currently maintained) library of direct and model-based 
regularised iterative reconstruction algorithms with a 
plug-and-play capability. ToMoBAR offers you a selection 
of various data models and regularisers resulting in complex 
objectives for tomographic reconstruction. ToMoBAR can handle 
multi-GPU parallel reconstruction in Python and also 
device-to-device methods operating on CuPy arrays.
