### Software includes:
 * A wrapper around [ASTRA-toolbox](https://www.astra-toolbox.com/) to simplify access to various reconstruction methods available in ASTRA
 * Regularised iterative ordered-subsets [FISTA](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/080716542) reconstruction algorithm with linear and non-linear data fidelities
 * Regularised iterative [ADMM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7744574/) reconstruction algorithm
 * [Access to multi-GPU capability through mpi4py library](https://github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR/blob/master/Demos/Python/MultiGPU_demo.py)
 * CuPy driven [forward/backward projectors](https://github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR/blob/master/Demos/Python/Demo_CuPy_3D.py) to enable faster device-to-device operations and all in GPU memory protoyping of algorithms
 * [Demos](https://github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR/tree/master/Demos) to reconstruct synthetic and also real data [4-6]

## Software highlights:
 * Tomographic parallel-beam projection data can be simulated without the "inverse crime" using [TomoPhantom](https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom). Noise and artifacts (zingers, rings, jitter) can be modelled and added to the data.
 * Simulated data reconstructed iteratively using FISTA or ADMM algorithms with multiple "plug-and-play" regularisers from [CCPi-RegularisationToolkit](https://github.com/vais-ral/CCPi-Regularisation-Toolkit) and GPU-accelerated wavelets from [pypwt](https://github.com/pierrepaleo/pypwt).
 * The FISTA algorithm offers various modifications: convergence acceleration with ordered-subsets method; data fidelities: PWLS, Kullback-Leibler, Huber, Group-Huber[2], Students't [3,4], and SWLS [5] to deal with noise and imaging artifacts (rings, streaks).

### General software prerequisites
 * Python or [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) (not actively maintained currently)

### Software dependencies
 * [ASTRA-toolbox](https://www.astra-toolbox.com/) for projection operations
 * [TomoPhantom](https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom) for tomographic data and phantoms simulations
 * [CCPi-RegularisationToolkit](https://github.com/vais-ral/CCPi-Regularisation-Toolkit) for regularisation [7]
 * Wavelet toolbox [pypwt](https://github.com/pierrepaleo/pypwt) if wavelet regularisation is used (optional)
 * [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for multi-GPU reconstruction control
 * [cupy](https://cupy.dev/) for GPU memory device-to-device operability
 * See [INSTALLATION](https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoRec/blob/master/INSTALLATION) for detailed information

### Python conda:
Install the ToMoBAR package from one of conda channels bellow:
```console
conda install -c dkazanc tomobar
conda install -c savu-dep tomobar
```

 or build using provided conda recipe:
```console
export VERSION=`date +%Y.%m` (unix) / set VERSION=2023.04 (Windows)
conda build conda-recipe/ --numpy 1.23 --python 3.10
conda install -c file://${CONDA_PREFIX}/conda-bld/ tomobar --force-reinstall
```
### Python development environment
* Clone the repository from GitHub page
* Install dependencies from the environment file (or from explicit list file)
* Activate the environment with :code:`conda activate tomobar`
* From the root directory install the enviroment in development mode with :code:`pip install -e .[dev]`

### MultiGPU capability
ToMoBAR can be used by running in parallel across multiple GPU devices on a PC or a compute node of a cluster. In order to initiate a parallel run on multiple GPUs you will need an MPI library, such as, [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). See this [demo](https://github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR/blob/master/Demos/Python/MultiGPU_demo.py).

### Matlab (is not currently supported)
Use available m-functions, see [Demos](https://github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR/tree/master/Demos/Matlab).

## How to use ToMoBAR in Python:
Please check [Demos](https://github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR/tree/master/Demos/Python) and also [Documetation](https://dkazanc.github.io/ToMoBAR/) with more detailed recipies how to run.

A typical setup for iterative reconstruction would include building three dictionaries: `_data_`, `_algorithm_` and `_regularisation_`. To list all accepted parameters for dictionaries do: 
```python
from tomobar.supp.dicts import dicts_check
help(dicts_check)
```
